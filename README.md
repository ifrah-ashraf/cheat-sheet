## üìñ How to Use
1. Browse through the folders to find the topic you are interested in.
2. Each folder contains cheat sheets related to a specific topic or tool.
3. Follow the instructions in each folder's `README.md` (if provided) for detailed guidance.

## ü§ù How to Contribute
We welcome contributions! If you have a topic to contribute or want to enhance an existing cheat sheet, follow the steps below:

1. **Create a separate folder** for your topic:
    - The folder name should be descriptive, indicating the topic (e.g., `JavaScript-Basics`, `Git-Commands`, `Data-Structures`).

2. **Add a `README.md` file** in your folder (if the sheet is complex):
    - Include clear instructions and explanations specific to your cheat sheet.
    - Make sure the `README.md` explains how to navigate or use the cheat sheet.

3. **Create a pull request**:
    - After you've added your folder and content, submit a pull request.
    - Provide a clear description of the changes or additions you've made in the pull request.

We appreciate all kinds of contributions, whether it's fixing a typo or creating a brand-new cheat sheet!
